# Inputs
An input is a type of function that takes in user input. By default an input returns its data (user input) in a form of a string. The following is an example of how you would create an input and print it out into the console.
```py filename='inputs.py' copy
name = input("What is your name? ")

print(name)
```
Alternatively we can print out something before we print the user input from the **name** variable by doing this
```py filename='inputs.py' copy
name = input("What is your name? ")

print("Your name is: ", name)

# ALTERNATIVE:

print(f'Your name is {name}')
```
