# Inputs
An input is a type of function that takes in user input. By default an input returns its data (user input) in a form of a string. The following is an example of how you would create an input and print it out into the console.
```py filename='inputs.py' copy
name = input("What is your name? ")

print(name)
```
Alternatively we can print out something before we print the user input from the **name** variable by doing this
```py filename='inputs.py' copy
name = input("What is your name? ")

print("Your name is: ", name)

# ALTERNATIVE:

print(f'Your name is {name}')
```
## Int (integer) Inputs
An integer input is a type of user input that is a **whole number**. With an integer input you can only place in a whole number by itself, if you add a letter or a decimal point then the code will fail. You can see an example of an integer input below.
```py filename='inputs.py' copy
num = int(input('Favourite number? '))

print(num)
```
As you can see with the integer input there is a slight difference when gathering the user input, just before you do the input function you need to tell it that it is going to get an int (integer) by putting the **int(input goes here)**.
