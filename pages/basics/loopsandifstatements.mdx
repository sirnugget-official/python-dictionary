# Loops and If Statements
Loops and if statements are a huge part of coding in Python. As such, you can use if statements if you are solving mathematic equations or making games. An if statement is formed by using the **if** keyword.
```py filename="loopsandstatements.py" copy
a = 10
b = 20

if a > b:
  print('A is greater than B.')
else:
  print('B is greater than A.')
```
I used 2 integer values in this example. A is 10 and B is 20, as we know B is going to be greater than A and this will print out **B is greater than A.** in the console.
## Elif
The elif keyword only runs if the previous statement is not true.
```py filename="loopsandstatements.py" copy
a = 10
b = 10

if a > b:
  print('A is greater than B.')
elif a == b:
  print('B and A are equal.')
```
The first condition is false, which means that it will skip to the elif statement and we will print into the console **"B and A are equal."**.

## Else
The else keyword runs if the previous statements do not catch onto anything.
```py filename="loopsandstatements.py" copy
a = 10
b = 20

if a > b:
  print('A is greater than B.')
elif a == b:
  print('A and B is equal.')
else:
  print('B is greater than A.')
```
