## Value Types
Here is a bit more on value types. There are numerous different value types on python with some of them including:

### Strings
A string is a value that contains text. In order to assign a string you need to do this
```py filename="valuetypes.py" copy
# Assigning the string...
string = "This is a string"

# Printing out the string into the console...
print(string)
```
This code block assigns the string value of **"This is a string"** and then prints it out into the console like we done before.

### Int
An int (or integer) is a type of whole number, it can be either positive or negative and cannot have decimals. To assign an int value you can do this
```py filename="main.py" copy
# Assign the int of 100
integer = 100

# Print out the int into the console
print(integer)
```
You can make this a little bit more complex by making using an input.
```py filename="valuetypes.py" copy
integer = int(input("Integer: "))

print(integer)
```
We will talk more about inputs later on but here is a basic piece of code explaining it. As you can see, we have to tell the input that it is going to be an integer value by adding on **int** to the start of the input.

### Float
A float is another type of number but a float can include decimal points like so
```py filename="valuetypes.py" copy
# Assigns the float value of 15.501
floatvar = 15.501

# Printing out the float value
print(floatvar)
```
If you run this code then it will print out **15.501** into the console.

### Boolean
A boolean represents one of two values, true or false.
```py filename='valuetypes.py' copy
booleanval = True

print(f'The current state of the boolean is: {booleanval}')
```
A boolean can also be returned by a function
```py filename='valuetypes.py' copy
def boolfunc():
  return True

print(boolfunc())
```
These pieces of code will return the value of **True**
