# Basics
Here are all the basics about python, inputs, print statements, and much more.

## Print Statements
This is a print statement.
```py filename="main.py" copy
print('Hello, World!')
```
You can use these to print anything you want into the console, currently it is going to print out **"Hello, World!"** when ran. You can expand this into something a little bit more complex by doing this
```py filename="main.py" copy
msg = "Hello, World!"

print(msg)
```
Now this will print out the exact same thing of **"Hello, World!"** but this time we are printing the value called **"msg"** with the value of **"Hello, World!"**

## F-Strings
You can use f-strings in the beginning of print statements for string interpolation and formatting.
```py filename="main.py" copy
name = input("What is your name? ")

print(f"You're name is: {name}") # Make sure you use double quotation marks at the start to avoid errors!
```

## Commenting
Comments can be used to explain your code, make it more readible, and stop the compiler from running the code. If something in your code starts with a **#** then python with ignore it and move to the next uncommented line.
```py filename="main.py" copy
# This is a comment
print('Hello!')
# You can use comments to comment out code to stop Python from executing it.
# print('Hello, World!')
```

You can also make a multi line comment by using triple quotation marks like so.
```py filename="main.py" copy
# This is a single line comment
"""
This is a
multi line 
comment
"""
```
This will work until you assign it to a variable
```py filename="main.py" copy
myvar = """
This is a 
multi line 
variable
"""
