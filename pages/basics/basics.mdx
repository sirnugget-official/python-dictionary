# Basics
Here are all the basics about python, inputs, print statements, and much more.

## Print Statements
This is a print statement.
```py filename="main.py" {3} copy
print('Hello, World!')
```
You can use these to print anything you want into the console, currently it is going to print out **"Hello, World!"** when ran. You can expand this into something a little bit more complex by doing this
```py filename="main.py" {3} copy
msg = "Hello, World!"

print(msg)
```
Now this will print out the exact same thing of **"Hello, World!"** but this time we are printing the variable called **"msg"** with the value of **"Hello, World!"**
