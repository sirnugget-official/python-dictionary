# Basics
Here are all the basics about python, inputs, print statements, and much more.

## Print Statements
This is a print statement.
```py filename="main.py" {3} copy
print('Hello, World!')
```
You can use these to print anything you want into the console, currently it is going to print out **"Hello, World!"** when ran. You can expand this into something a little bit more complex by doing this
```py filename="main.py" {3} copy
msg = "Hello, World!"

print(msg)
```
Now this will print out the exact same thing of **"Hello, World!"** but this time we are printing the variable called **"msg"** with the value of **"Hello, World!"**

## Variables
Here is a bit more on variables. There are numerous different variable types on python with some of them including:

### Strings
A string is a variable that contains text. In order to assign a string you need to do this
```py filename="main.py" {3} copy
# Assigning the string...
string = "This is a string"

# Printing out the string into the console...
print(string)
```
This code block assigns the string value of **"This is a string"** and then prints it out into the console like we done before.

### Int
An int (or integer) is a type of whole number, it can be either positive or negative and cannot have decimals. To assign an int value you can do this
```py filename="main.py" {3} copy
# Assign the int of 100
integer = 100

# Print out the int into the console
print(integer)
```
You can make this a little bit more complex by making using an input.
```py filename="main.py" {3} copy
integer = int(input("Integer: ")

print(integer)
```
We will talk more about inputs later on but here is a basic piece of code explaining it. As you can see, we have to tell the input that it is going to be an integer value by adding on **int** to the start of the input.

### Float
A float is another type of number but a float can include decimal points like so
```py filename="main.py" {3} copy
# Assigns the float value of 15.501
floatvar = 15.501

# Printing out the float value
print(floatvar)
```
If you run this code then it will print out **15.501** into the console.
