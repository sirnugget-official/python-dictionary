# Introduction
 
Welcome to the Python Dictionary! Here you can find *almost* everything you ever wanted to know about Python!

## What is the Python Dictionary?

The Python Dictionary is a way for you to easily learn Python. I am hoping to expand this to include other coding languages in the near future.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, you need to have a Python IDE (Integrated Development Environment). I will be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) but you can use [Grok Academy](https://groklearning.com), [Replit](https://replit.com), Pycharm and many more. Choose whichever one fits your liking the best out of all of them. If you are using Visual Studio Code or Pycharm you will need to have Python installed onto your computer by either downloading it from [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9p7qfqmjrfp7?hl=en-gb&gl=US) or from the [Python website directly](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
